# Zoorl - a serverless URL shortener service based on AWS stack

A simple URL shortner application done with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and CDK. I created it as a case study for different AWS technologies.

* [Backend](backend/README.md) - this is the CDK App + REST API (based on AWS Lambda)
  * [Lambda business code](backend/lambda/README.md) - if you need to develop the Python code, this may help
* Frontend - TODO

## What 'zoorl' stands for ?

It is a contraction of "Zipped URL", with "u" replaced by "oo" to be "cooler" :P
